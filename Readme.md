Insights of the Project-

The project mainly focuses on the real time country-wise infected data of Covid19 via graphs.
The left hand side of the first page shows the list of all the countries along with their total Covid Cases till
date.
On clicking on respective countries, we can see their daily cumulative data.
Next we have a world map which shows total Active Cases, Confirm Cases, Patients Recovered and Deaths.
Rolling on each country will show its current infected population, Deaths, Comfirmed Cases and REcovered
cases depending on the category you select.Then we have a functionality, in which if you click on play button it will show you the how the Covid expanded from Day 1 till date.
The above graph also depends upon the type you select. 
Below the play functionality, a similary feature but in the form of line graph is there that again shows you the covid cases. This also depends upon the category you select.
We also have a contact us page where a person can send in his/her query where we require his email so that we can contact over email.
At last, we have some do's and don' that one should follow to save himself/herself from getting infected.
